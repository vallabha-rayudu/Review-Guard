deceiving unsuspecting buyers. To combat this issue, The proposed NLP and ML-Based Framework 
for Identifying Fraudulent Sellers. The framework leverages natural language processing (NLP) and 
machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze seller profiles, product descriptions, and customer 
reviews. The approach utilizes a combination of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and 
classification algorithms to identify potential red flags and detect fraudulent sellers. To evaluate the
